CP1404 Practical Reflection
"""

"""What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?"""
# 100% RAHHHH!!!!!

"""What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?"""
# At home, full day monday for pre-recorded lectures.
# Generally hope to finish between 12-3pm but tend to do it at night :/

"""What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?"""
# Probably just completing content (eventually).
# Organised enough that I'll be finished before the next week starts.

"""What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?"""
# Stop leaving pre-recorded lectures to the last minute.
# Generally don't finish them in time before the seminar and my practical is right after,
# so I'm doing the work with knowledge gaps. (Though I usually fix this after)

"""What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?"""
# I'm rather inefficient in practicals because of the setting.
# Though mostly just getting interrupted either by people talking to me or other noise.
# Then I'm distracted and takes a while to refocus.
# I should probably bring noise-cancelling headphones or something, put my phone on silent, etc.

"""What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?"""
# Spending time after practicals to look back at my code and compare to solutions.
# Usually updating or fixing anything where relevant to improve my code.
