# CP1404 Practicals

Keya Wong's personal repository of practical work for IT@JCU CP1404 2025.
Contains various exercising and small programs completed to learn clean python coding.
This code standard is based off these [Programming Patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns).

## Lesson's learnt on clean code
1. DRY - do not repeat yourself. 
2. Variable names should align with their types i.e. CONSTANT, key_to_value, lists
3. Code should be as self-explanatory as possible. Don't 100% rely on comments to explain simple code.
